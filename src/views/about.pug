        p For the seniors in FIU’s Department of Electrical and Computer
            | Engineering, everything they’ve learned in four years
            | culminates with a single project. Working together in teams,
            | they take on projects that test their knowledge, ingenuity,
            | patience and imagination. Finally, on Senior Design Day,
            | the students put on their best suits and showcase their
            | projects to a host of industry advisers who pick their brains
            | and give them feedback on their work. The Senior Project
            | course was created to test a potential graduates ability to
            | work in a real software development environment. Potential
            | graduates' success in this course will enable them to provide
            | a significant software project that may help them land a job
            | in the real-world.
